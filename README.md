# Chronos32: A DIY 32-bit CPU on a Breadboard

Welcome to the Chronos32 project! This ambitious endeavor aims to design, build, and program a fully functional 32-bit central processing unit (CPU) using breadboards, wires, and basic electronic components. This project is not commercial and is not permitted for comercial use.

Updates need to be made from this part of the document down.

## Project Goals

1. **Educational:** To provide a hands-on learning experience for electronics enthusiasts and aspiring computer engineers.
2. **Experimental:** To explore the fundamental principles of computer architecture and digital logic in a tangible way.
3. **Proof of Concept:** To demonstrate that a functional CPU can be constructed using readily available materials and a DIY approach.

## Project Scope

* **32-Bit Architecture:**  The CPU will be based on a 32-bit instruction set architecture (ISA), allowing it to handle data and addresses up to 32 bits in size.
* **Breadboard Implementation:** The entire CPU will be constructed on breadboards, showcasing the feasibility of building complex digital circuits with readily available components.
* **Basic Functionality:** The CPU will implement a core set of instructions for arithmetic operations, logical operations, memory access, and control flow.
* **Assembly Programming:** Programs will be written in assembly language to test and demonstrate the CPU's capabilities.

## Design Overview

* **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):** The ISA will define the format of instructions, the operations they perform, and the addressing modes they support.
* **Registers:** The CPU will have a set of general-purpose registers for storing data and addresses.
* **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** The ALU will perform arithmetic and logical operations on data.
* **Control Unit:** The control unit will fetch instructions from memory, decode them, and generate control signals to execute them.
* **Memory:** The CPU will use external SRAM or DRAM for storing instructions and data.

## Project Timeline (Estimated)

1. **Phase 1: Design and Simulation (4-6 weeks)**
    * Define the ISA.
    * Design the CPU architecture using digital logic design software.
    * Simulate the design to verify its functionality.
2. **Phase 2: Breadboard Construction (6-8 weeks)**
    * Gather the necessary components (breadboards, wires, ICs, etc.).
    * Construct the CPU on a breadboard following the design.
    * Debug and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
3. **Phase 3: Programming and Testing (4-6 weeks)**
    * Write assembly language programs to test different CPU functions.
    * Develop a simple debugger to aid in testing and debugging.
    * Demonstrate the CPU's capabilities with sample programs.

## Getting Started

1. **Familiarize Yourself with Digital Logic:** Learn the basics of logic gates, flip-flops, registers, and other digital building blocks.
2. **Study Computer Architecture:** Understand the fundamentals of CPU design, instruction sets, and addressing modes.
3. **Gather Components:** Collect the necessary breadboards, wires, ICs, and other electronic components.
4. **Start Building:** Follow the design and schematics to construct the CPU on a breadboard.
5. **Start Programming:**  Write assembly language programs to test and demonstrate the CPU's capabilities.

## Challenges and Considerations

* **Complexity:** Building a CPU from scratch is a complex task that requires careful planning and attention to detail.
* **Debugging:**  Identifying and fixing errors in the design and construction can be time-consuming.
* **Limited Resources:** A breadboard CPU will have limited memory and processing power compared to commercial CPUs.
