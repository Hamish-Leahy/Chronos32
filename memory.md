## Memory for your 32-bit CPU: A Deeper Dive

Memory is crucial for your CPU to store instructions, data, and intermediate results. Understanding different memory types and their characteristics will help you make informed decisions for your project.

### Key Memory Types

* **Random Access Memory (RAM):**
    * **Purpose:** Stores data and instructions that the CPU actively uses.
    * **Types:**
        * **Static RAM (SRAM):** Fast, expensive, and uses flip-flops for storage.
        * **Dynamic RAM (DRAM):** Slower, cheaper, and uses capacitors that need refreshing.
    * **Consideration for your project:** SRAM is likely a better choice for the small amount of memory needed for a breadboard CPU due to its simplicity and speed.

* **Read-Only Memory (ROM):**
    * **Purpose:** Stores permanent or semi-permanent data that is not meant to be changed frequently, like the BIOS or firmware.
    * **Types:**
        * **Mask ROM:**  Programmed during manufacturing, non-writable.
        * **Programmable ROM (PROM):** Can be written once by the user.
        * **Erasable Programmable ROM (EPROM):** Can be erased and reprogrammed.
        * **Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM (EEPROM):** Can be erased and reprogrammed electrically.
    * **Consideration for your project:** You might not need ROM for a very basic CPU, but if you want to store a simple boot program or basic instructions, a small EEPROM chip could be useful.

### Memory Addressing

* **Address Bus:** A set of wires that the CPU uses to specify the memory location it wants to access.
* **Data Bus:** A set of wires that transfers data between the CPU and memory.
* **32-bit Addressing:** Your 32-bit CPU can theoretically address up to 4GB (2^32) of memory. However, for a breadboard project, you'll likely use a much smaller amount.

### Memory Implementation on a Breadboard

1. **Memory Chips:** Choose SRAM or DRAM chips based on your needs and budget.
2. **Address Decoding:** Design a circuit (e.g., using a decoder IC) to translate addresses from the CPU into specific chip select signals for each memory chip.
3. **Data Connections:** Connect the data lines of the memory chips to the CPU's data bus.
4. **Control Signals:** Use control signals from the CPU (like read/write) to control the memory chips.

### Additional Tips

* **Start Small:**  Begin with a small amount of memory (e.g., a few kilobytes) and gradually increase it as you gain experience.
* **Memory Mapping:**  Decide how you want to organize your memory (e.g., where to store instructions, data, and the stack).
* **Refresh Circuit (for DRAM):** If you use DRAM, design a refresh circuit to periodically refresh the memory cells.
